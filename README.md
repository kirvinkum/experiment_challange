#### ------ Screenshots ------


#### ------ Tech stack ------
* Django restfamework (backend)
* React js (frontend)
* SQLite (database)
* Centos (demo deployment)

#### ------ Features ------

#### Secure rest api

#### Secure login at frontend

  * React hooks usage context usage
	
#### Accept multiple experiments
  * To allows comparison of historical data
  * And to support future data

#### Experimental data upload

  * Multiple file uploads via frontend
  * Validations
  * Map files data to objects
  * Usage to transactions for roll back
